             Early on, Poughkeepsie was also a major center for whale rendering, and during the 19th century industry 
             flourished through shipping, hatteries, paper mills, and several breweries along the Hudson River, including
             some owned by Matthew Vassar, founder of Vassar College. Due to the areaâ€™s natural beauty and proximity 
             to New York City, families such as the Astors, Rogers, and Vanderbilts built palatial weekend homes nearby. 
             
             The Vanderbilt mansion, located several miles up the Hudson from Poughkeepsie, is registered as a National 
             Historic Site; it is considered to be a sterling example of the mansions built by American industrialists 
             during the late 19th century. The city is also home to the oldest continuously operating entertainment 
             venue in the state, the Bardavon 1869 Opera House.
